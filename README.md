WHAT YOU NEED TO RUN CODE

1. download and install node.js
2. install a Text Editor such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime


RETRIEVE CODE
1. git clone the repo on your local machine
2. run command , npm install
3. run command, node index , the dev site should be on localhost:5000 on your browser

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE

1. the code is rendering from a node + express server at index.js
2.  /views includes all the pages
3. save any images in public/images
4. the server has the public folder set for static assets so if you need to link an image in the html, you just need to do /images/yourFile.jpg instead of /public/images/yourFile.jpg
5. each page has its own css file to stay organized.
6. localhost:500 does not hot reload when you make changes so you have to reload manually to see what you have done 


HOW WE WILL COLLABORATE
1. Fork the target repo to your own account.
2. Clone the repo to your local machine.
3. Check out a new "topic branch" and make changes.
4. Push your topic branch to your fork.
5. Use the diff viewer on GitHub to create a pull request via a discussion.
6. Make any requested changes.
7. The pull request is then merged (usually into the master branch) and the topic branch is deleted from the upstream (target) repo.
